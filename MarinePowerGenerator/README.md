# Marine Power Generator

MATLAB project

## Electrical Engineering Calculations for a three-phase Marine Power Generator

This project was submitted for the requirements of the course: "Electrotechnical Applications and Electrical Laboratory for Naval Architects and Marine Engineers" (8058) of the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

There is not much coding-wise. It is pure calculation. Thus, the project is just uploaded to be archived.

The project involves the analysis and simulation of a three-phase induction motor using MATLAB. 
The goal of the project is to study various motor characteristics, impedance calculations, and finally power and torque calculations for a given set of motor parameters, for a marine power generator.

In this repository, there is a script with the computations and a JPG file that showcases the torque-speed diagram for the operating generator.
