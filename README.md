## Navigation

To explore the projects, you can navigate through the folders corresponding to each course. Each folder is typically structured as follows:

```{Project_Name}/```: Contains the project files, including code, documentation, and any additional resources.

```README.md```: Provides a brief overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for running or replicating the analysis (if applicable).

The ```README.md``` also contains information regarding the course or research.
