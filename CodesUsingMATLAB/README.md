## Mathematical Codes using MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions for solving various mathematical problems. Each script or function targets a specific problem or set of related problems. These problems were solved for the requirements of the course "Programming using MATLAB" (8010) of the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Usage

Each MATLAB script or function comes with detailed comments explaining its purpose, input arguments, and output. To use a particular script or function, simply download the corresponding file and run it in MATLAB. Adjust the input parameters as needed for your specific problem.
