# Marine Power Generator

MATLAB project

## Electrical Engineering Calculations for a three-phase Marine Power Generator

This project was submitted for the requirements of the course: "Electrotechnical Applications & Electrical Laboratory for Naval Architects and Marine Engineers" (8058) of the School of Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

There is not much coding-wise. It is pure calculation. Thus, the project is just uploaded in order to be archived.

The project involves the analysis and simulation of a three-phase induction motor using MATLAB. 
The goal of the project is to study various motor characteristics, impedance calculations, and finally power and torque calculations for a given set of motor parameters, for a marine power generator.

In this repository, there is a script with the computations and a JPG file that showcases the torque-speed diagram for the operating generator.
