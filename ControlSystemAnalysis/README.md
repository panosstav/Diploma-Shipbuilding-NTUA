# Control System Analysis

MATLAB/Simulink project

## Control Systems & Dynamic Responses

This project was submitted for the requirements of the course: "Introduction to Automatic Control Systems" (8090) of the School of Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

The objective of this project is to design a controller and an observer in MATLAB and simulate both of them in Simulink.
Each subtopic appears to have its own set of calculations, simulations, and plots.

## Usage

The MATLAB code in this repository can be used for:
- Simulating control system behavior
- Analyzing transient responses
- Designing controllers
- Implementing observer-based control
- Visualizing system responses
- Detailed usage instructions and examples can be found within the MATLAB script files.

## Simulation and Analysis

To simulate and analyze the control system, follow these steps:

- Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
- Open the MATLAB script that corresponds to the aspect of the control system you want to analyze.
- Run the script to simulate the system.
- Analyze the results using MATLAB's plotting and analysis tools.
