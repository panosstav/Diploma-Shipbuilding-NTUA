## Mathematical Codes using FORTRAN

This repository contains FORTRAN scripts and functions for solving various mathematical problems. Each script or function targets a specific problem or set of related problems. These problems were solved for the requirements of the course "FORTRAN and Object-Oriented Programming" (8195) of the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Usage

Each MATLAB script or function comes with detailed comments explaining its purpose, input arguments, and output. To use a particular script or function, simply download the corresponding file and run it in FTN95. Adjust the input parameters as needed for your specific problem.
